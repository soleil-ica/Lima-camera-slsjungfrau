<P>
Normally, the firmware will be upgraded by us as it requires programming the
FPGA via the USB-Blaster.

<P>
To upgrade the firmware you need either a working version of the Altera
Quartus software or of the Quartus programmer, which can easily be downloaded
from:

  HREF="https://www.altera.com/download/programming/quartus2/pq2-index.jsp">https://www.altera.com/download/programming/quartus2/pq2-index.jsp</A></TT>
<P>
Normally, installation of the software and of the driver for the
USB-Blaster (provided together with the MYTHEN detector) are simpler under
Windows.

<P>
Under Windows, the first time that you connect the USB-Blaster to one
of your USB ports, you will be asked to install new hardware. Set the path to
search for the driver to:
<code>C:\altera\80sp1\qprogrammer\drivers\usb-blasterp</code> (where 
<code>C:\altera\80sp1\qprogrammer\</code> is assumed to be ther path where your
Quartus version is installed).

<OL>
<LI>After starting the Quartus programmer, click on Hardware Setup and in the
"Currently selected hardware" window select USB-Blaster.
</LI>
<LI>In the Mode combo box select "Active Serial Programming".
</LI>
<LI>Plug the end of your USB-Blaster WITH THE ADAPTER PROVIDED in the
connector ASMI on the MCS board taking care that pin1 corresponds to the one
indexed and with the rectangualr pad.
</LI>
<LI>Click on add file and from select the programming file provided when
the upgrade has been reccomended.
</LI>
<LI>Check "Program/Configure" and "Verify".
</LI>
<LI>Push the start button and wait until the programming process is
finished (progress bar top left).
</LI>
<LI>In case the programmer gives you error messages, check the polarity of
your cable (pin1 corresponds) and that you have selected the correct programming
connector.
