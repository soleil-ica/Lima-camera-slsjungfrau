Requirements</A>
</H2>
These are the basic requirements to install and use the software. Fine Tuning
the system will be discussed in other documentation provided.

<UL>
<LI><I>C/C++</I>:
<BR>
The software is written in C/C++. If Python API is used, it is a wrap around
to the C++ software.  Any Linux installation with working libgcc should be
sufficient.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>Shared Memory</I>:
<BR>
Access to the shared memory of the control PC is required for the client.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>Network</I>:
<BR>
The control PC communicates to the detectors and data receivers over TCP/IP.
Therefore, the detector should receive a proper IP address (either DHCP or
static) and no firewall should be present between the control PC and the
detector.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>Compilation</I>:
<BR>
cmake is required to compile. make is also possible, but is harder to find
dependencies.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>GUI</I>:
<BR>
To use the GUI, one requires atleast Qt4.8.2 and Qwt6.0. Installation of these
are discussed in the next sections.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>Calibration Wizards</I>:
<BR>
They are based on the CERN Root data analysis framework. Installation of it is
discussed in the next sections.
