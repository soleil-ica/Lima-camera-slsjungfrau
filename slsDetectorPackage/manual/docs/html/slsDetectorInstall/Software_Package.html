The Software Package</A>
</H1>
The SLS detectors software is intended to control the detectors developed by
the SLS Detectors group. The detectors currently supported are:

<P>
MYTHEN, GOTTHARD, EIGER and JUNGFRAU.

<P>
The package provides software for the distributed system that comprises of
detectors, data receivers (to process detector data), and the client (to control
or monitor the system). The client and data receivers can be embedded in
the user's acquisitions system. Furthermore, the package also provides some
tools for detector calibration.
