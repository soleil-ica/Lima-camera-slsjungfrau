The complete software package is composed of several programs which
can be installed (or locally compiled) depending on one's requirements:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">libSlsDetector.so, libSlsReceiver.so</FONT>:
<BR>
The <I>slsDetector shared and static libraries</I>, which are
necessary for all user interfaces. The <I>C++ API</I> via the class
<I>slsDetectorUsers</I> (installed with the default package) or the
<I>Python API</I> via the class <I>sls_detector</I> (installed with the
package including Python API), which can be used from the user's acquisition
software to control the detectors and the data receivers.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">sls_detector_put, sls_detector_get,
sls_detector_acquire, sls_detector_help</FONT>: 
<BR>
The <I>command line interfaces</I>, which are provided to communicate with the
detectors and data receivers using the command line.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">slsReceiver</FONT>: 
<BR>
The <I>data receiver</I>, which can be run on a different machine than the
client, receives the data from the detector and processes it. The receiver can
be configured, controlled and monitored by the client.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">slsMultiReceiver</FONT>: 
<BR>
It is the same as the <I>slsReceiver</I>, but that it is a single process 
for many multiple slsReceiver child processes. One can configure the start TCP port,
number of slsReceiver processes and if call back should be enabled or not.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">slsDetectorGUI</FONT>: 
<BR>
The <I>graphical user interface</I>, which provides a user friendly way
of operating the detectors and data receivers with online data preview.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">energyCalibrationWizard,angularCalibrationWizard</FONT>: 
<BR>
The <I>calibration wizards</I> to analyze the data and produce the energy or
angular calibration files.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <I>virtual Detector servers</I> to simulate the detectors behavior.
However, only control commands work, not the data acquisition itself.
