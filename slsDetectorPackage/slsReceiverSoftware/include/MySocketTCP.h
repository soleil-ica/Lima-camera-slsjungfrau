/*
  canceled SetupParameters() and varaibles intialized in the constructors' headers;
  defined SEND_REC_MAX_SIZE (for compatibilty with mythen (and possibly other)  pure C servers (i would move it to the common header file)

  added #ifndef C_ONLY... to cutout class definition when including in pure C servers (can be removed if SEND_REC_MAX_SIZE is moved to the common header file)

  defined private variables char hostname[1000] and int portno to store connection informations;

  defined public functions  int getHostname(char *name) and  int getPortNumber() to retrieve connection informations
  
  added public function int getErrorStatus() returning 1 if socketDescriptor<0

  remove exits in the constructors and replace them with socketDescriptor=-1

  replaced the argument of send/receive data with void (to avoid too much casting or compiler errors/warnings)

  added a function which really does not close the socket between send/receive (senddataonly, receivedataonly)
